**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This addon will be installed for all profiles. You can not remove the addon through Firefox - only manually by removing the folder from \extensions or by uninstalling the package. You will have to confirm in Firefox if you want to enable the addon (thats a security feature of Firefox). You can Disable it within Firefox. Subsequent updates should be dealt with automatically by Firefox.
